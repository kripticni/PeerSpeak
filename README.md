# PeerSpeak

Started as a highschool project but I'm looking
forward to extending it much further.  

## Version 1

Created a C# windows forms app with the ability  
to configure profiles, send messages, share files  
securely with tls and handling of multipul chat  
clients at once.  

## Version 2

Port the application over to C++ to make it usable  
on any platform and with a nicer UI.  
Using:  
- Dear ImGui  
- SDL2/SDL3  
- OpenGL  
- OpenSSL  
- GPGME
- Asio  
- SQLiteCpp  
And building with cmake and clang++ to allow  
for use on any platform.
